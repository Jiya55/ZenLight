Notes for my easy scroll and important points:-
0. i will write most of code again better if you say and keep only login(i just wrote it cause main webpage was empty in repo)
1. for any issue that needs other user concern find it by typing "concernX" in ctrl+f in which ever editor you prefer, where X is natural number starting from 1 .
2. this is a dummy website you can link your main website to home button or link the login functionality or do as you see fit or you can ask me to make any modification for your convinience
3. you can add your issue in whichever format you like just mention it in readme or anyway you prefer.

4. comment on what i need to improve(a must)
5. just in case mentioning to run backend on VSCode you need to install mangodb(community server) , node.js(LTS) from official websites then install them in yourworkspace just in case future for reference ...in workspce terminal (
