Notes for my easy scroll and important points:-
0. i will scrape most of code if you say and keep only login(i just wrote it cause main webpage was empty in repo)
1. for any issue that needs other user concern find it by typing "concernX" in ctrl+f in which ever editor you prefer, where X is natural number starting from 1 .
2. this is a dummy website you can link your main website to home button or link the login functionality or do as yopu see fi or you can ask me to make any modification for your convinience
3. you can add your issue in whichever format you like just mention it in readme or anyway you prefer.
4. comment on what i need to improve
